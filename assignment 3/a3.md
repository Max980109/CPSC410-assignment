# CPSC 410 - Assignment 3

## Exercise 1

1.  
    * Type of study: Observational / Exploratory Studies

    * Threats: The first threat belongs to `internal validity`. Developers may have biases towards the IDE, so we may not say the result is solely based on our manipulations.  The second threat belongs to `external validity`.  There are many kinds of developers, so our sample is too small and not repersentative.  The thrid threat belongs to `empirical reliabliltiy/ reproducability`.  If we choose another 50 developers, we are possible unable to generate the same results.

2.  
    * Type of study: Historical Data Collection and Analysis

    * Threats: The first threat belongs to `internal validity`. Although there is strong correlation between number of bugs and number of commits showed in our analysis, we are unable to conclued is as a causal relationshiop.  The second threat belongs to `external validity`.  We may not find this correlation in other projects, so our findings can not be generalized.

3.  
    * Type of study: Observational / Exploratory Studies

    * Threats: The threat belongs to `construct validity`. The DSL language's aim users are kids. The concepts and effictiveness of the DSL could not be correctly measured if we ask developers to use the DSL.
